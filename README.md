# Python + Arch + Installer

## Documentation

- How to run our installer

```bash
sudo pacman -Sy git
git clone https://github.com/Sherry65-code/Parcher
cd Parcher
chmod a+x ./run.sh
./run.sh
```
- How its different
  - This installer is targetted towards begginers who have only a little experience in linux.
  - It is faster than other installers and less crapy by removing the waste options.
  - We think that if the user uses the advanced options that he should not need this installer and install arch himself/herself.
