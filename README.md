- How its different
  - This installer is targetted towards begginers who have only a little experience in linux.
  - It is faster than other installers and less crapy by removing the waste options.
  - We think that if the user uses the advanced options that he should not need this installer and install arch himself/herself.
  
- Some issues with pacman which Arch Installation
  - If git is not installating then press `Ctrl+D` on your keyboard and then try installing git.
